Summary
---------
I want to become a Front End developer. Why Front End? Because it is very interesting to me. This is both technical and, to some extent, creative work. The ability to create beautiful, technically complex sites and web applications, think through the algorithms of their work - that is my goal. In life, I am a persistent and purposeful person. If something doesn’t work out for me, I’m ready to work hard to catch up and achieve my goal. This is my motivation.

Skills
----------

**I had some experience with the following technologies and tools:**


* HTML5;
* CSS;
* JS;
* ES6;
* Adobe Photoshop;
* Git;
* GitHub;
* IDE (JetBrains Webstorm);
* Chrome DevTools.


Code example
--------------------

**This is case-insensitive sorting of object by properties (JavaScript sort() method):**

    let peopleBase = [
        {FirstName: "John", LastName: "Jackson",},
        {FirstName: "Jack", LastName: "anderson",},
        {FirstName: "frodo", LastName: "Bagins",},
        {FirstName: "Sam", LastName: "Torbins",},
        ];

    const by = field => {
        const fieldComparison = (a, b) => {

            let as = a[field].toLowerCase();
            let bs = b[field].toLowerCase();

            if (as > bs) return 1;
            if (as < bs) return -1;

            return 0;

        };
        return fieldComparison;
    };

      arr = peopleBase.sort(by("FirstName")); //Sorting can be done by "first name" or "last name".


      console.log(arr);


Experience
----------------------------------------

algorithms, etc.
